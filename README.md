WP Tweaks
=========

This is a WordPress must-use plugin, aiming to centralize some tweaks and
helpers that I use on 99% of the WordPress websites that I build. It's not
registered on [wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/), because I don't
think that people would actually want to use this as is, but I'm putting it on
GitHub, because GitHub is pretty cool (plus, free code hosting, yay!). I'm also
planning to publish it on Packagist, just to make things a little easier for me
in `composer.json`.

Disclaimer
----------

This plugin is meaningful and useful to me; it may not be (and certainly isn't
at all) the case for everyone.
